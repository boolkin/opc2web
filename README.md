All added tags to client can be viewed on special page, where you can add blocks with tags, change their color, names, size, and so on. Check how it works at https://boolkin.github.io/opc2web/


Another version more beautiful and more functional because use svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) - something of HMI. But not so universal. Test it here https://boolkin.github.io/opc2web/svg/
